Dataset to build the expression recognition are from [FER dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013).

I make two type of model, one from scratch and one with pre-trained VGG19 Imagenet.
The requirement needed is:
1. scratch model : 224x224, channel 3, good if its displayed grayscale
2. Pre trained model : 150x150, channel 3, good if its displayed grayscal

due to limited amount of memory could be uploaded,
all the model file are in this drive (VGG19 and scratch model)

the test with python based are in the file Test_Model.ipynb

Thats all.
